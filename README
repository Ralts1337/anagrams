Changed from starter code for the Anagrams workshop. 

This workshop is part of the Applied CS with Android course:


http://g.co/cswithandroid

Start code can be found in the website above. 

How to play:
Given a word, find the anagrams of it by adding one letter.
However, you cannot use the given word as a substring.
Example:
Given: Dog
ok: good
not ok: dogs

Click the drop down menu on the top right corner to 
increase/decrease the given word length.
It won't go below 3 or above 7. 

Have fun.
